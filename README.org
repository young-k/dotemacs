* My Emacs Configuration
** How To Install

First, make sure you don't have a .emacs file. 

You can back up your .emacs.d directory if you have one by doing ~mv .emacs.d dotemacs~, which will store your configuration in the ~dotemacs~ folder.

To import this configuration, do

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/young-k/dotemacs.git .emacs.d
#+END_SRC

** Pre-Packages
Some basic information:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(setq user-full-name "Young Kim"
      user-mail-address "young-k@protonmail.com")
#+END_SRC

Pickiness:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
;; Asks "y-or-n" instead of asking "yes-or-no"
(fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)

;; Set font to DejaVu Sans Mono
;; Mostly for Linux / Windows since DejaVu Sans Mono comes with Mac
(when (member "DejaVu Sans Mono" (font-family-list))
  (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "DejaVu Sans Mono"))
#+END_SRC
** My Many Packages
*** Markdown-Mode
*** Auto-Complete
*** Aggressive-Indent
*** Helm / Helm-Swoop
*** Tex
*** Smartparens
*** Flycheck 
*** Dracula Theme
Probably my favorite theme. I run it on both my zsh and my emacs.
