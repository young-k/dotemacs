* My Emacs Configuration
** How To Install

First, make sure you don't have a .emacs file. 

You can back up your .emacs.d directory if you have one by doing ~mv .emacs.d dotemacs~, which will store your configuration in the ~dotemacs~ folder.

To import this configuration, do

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/young-k/dotemacs.git .emacs.d
#+END_SRC
